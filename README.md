# Data Science Projects
A collection of my data science projects

This repository contains a collection of my data science projects involving data analysis using Python and SQL from various courses and datasets. These projects are mostly in Python programming language using Jupyter Notebook. 
A lot of these projects are from DataCamp, DataCamp workspace and various sources on the internet. This repository is a work in progress as I continue learning and delving into the field of data science.

Here, I am providing a list of projects covered so far with DataCamp:

### Investigating Netflix Movies and Guest Stars in The Office- Unguided Project, DataCamp 
* **Code/File:** [Go to File](https://github.com/sadafaleem/data_science_projects/tree/main/Investigating%20Netflix%20Movies%20and%20Guest%20Stars%20in%20The%20Office%20Unguided)
*  **Source/Course:** DataCamp
*   **Description:** In this project, we identified which guest stars appear in the most popular episode of "The Office". We used python skills to study and plot data on the history of the sitcom The Office. 
This project covers following steps: loading data from csv file, getting insight into dataset provided using methods and attributes, creating plot using matplotlib to discover trends in data,discovering meaningful insight from plots.
* **Topics Covered/Skills:** Python, data visualization, accessing data, identifyiing trends and exploratory data analysis
* **Technology:**  Python, matplotlib, pandas
* **Result:** Using our analysis to identify most popular episode and guest starts which appeared in that episode. We also studied trend in episode's popularity and ratings.


###  Investigating Netflix Movies and Guest Stars in The Office Guided Project, DataCamp
* **Code/File:** [Go to File](https://github.com/sadafaleem/data_science_projects/tree/main/Investigating%20Netflix%20Movies%20and%20Guest%20Stars%20in%20The%20Office)
* **Source/Course:** DataCamp
* **Description:** In this project, we explored if Netflix’s movies are getting shorter over time and conducted some exploratory data analysis using python and its libraries; pandas andmatplotlib. This project covers following steps: creating pandas dataframe from dictionary, creating line plot, loading data from csv file as a DataFrame, subsetting DataFrame based on condition (movies only)  and selecting selected columns, creating scatter plot, further subsetting data to examine short movies under 60 minutes 
* **Topics Covered/Skills:** Foundational Python skills, exploratory data analysis, working with raw data, visualization
* **Technology:**  Python, matplotlib, pandas
* **Result:** Non-feature films are generally of shorter duration.

###	What and Where Are the World's Oldest Businesses? – using SQL -Guided Project , DataCamp
* **Code/File:** [Go to File](https://github.com/sadafaleem/data_science_projects/tree/main/What%20and%20Where%20Are%20the%20World's%20Oldest%20Businesses_SQL)
* **Source/Course:** DataCamp
* **Description:** This project involves exploring data on worlds's oldest businesses. The data is taken from BusinessFinancing.co.uk. The project involves answering questions such as when were oldest businesses founded and to which industry do they belong to.
* **Topics Covered/Skills:** This project covers following steps: querying data, joining tables, manipulation tools such as grouping and filtering
* **Technology:** SQL
* **Result:** Six business were founded before 1000. Oldest business belonged to Construction category.
