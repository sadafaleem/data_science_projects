# Data Science Projects
A collection of my data science projects

This repository contains a collection of my data science projects involving data analysis using Python and SQL from various courses and datasets. These projects are mostly in Python programming language using Jupyter Notebook. 
A lot of these projects are from DataCamp, DataCamp workspace and various sources on the internet. This repository is a work in progress as I continue learning and delving into the field of data science.

Here, I am providing a list of projects covered so far with DataCamp:
### Investigating Netflix Movies and Guest Stars in The Office- Unguided Project, DataCamp 
* **Code/File:** Go to File
* **Source/Course:** DataCamp
* **Description:** In this project, we explored if Netflix’s movies are getting shorter over time. This project covers following steps: creating pandas dataframe from dictionary, creating line plot, loading data from csv file as a DataFrame, subsetting DataFrame based on condition (movies only)  and selecting selected columns, creating scatter plot, further subsetting data to examine short movies under 60 minutes 
* **Topics Covered/Skills:** Foundational Python skills, exploratory data analysis, working with raw data, visualization
* **Technology:**  Python, matplotlib, pandas
* **Result:** Non-feature films are generally of shorter duration.
